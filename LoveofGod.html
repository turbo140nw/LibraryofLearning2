        <h1>Peace</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, during the middle of the civil war, on christmas day of 1863, wrote a poem that eventually, in the year 1872,  became a christmas carol. He wrote the poem after his son had returned from fighting from the Union army  with a nearly fatal injury. This is part of the poem,</p>
        <p>"Then from each black, accursed mouth</p>
        <p>The cannon thundered in the South,</p>
        <p>And with the sound</p>
        <p>The carols drowned</p>
        <p>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!</p>
		<p>It was as if an earthquake rent</p>
        <p>The hearth-stones of a continent,</p>
        <p>And made forlorn</p>
        <p>The households born</p>
        <p>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!</p>
        <p>And in despair I bowed my head;</p>
        <p>'There is no peace on earth,' I said;</p>
        <p>'For hate is strong,</p>
        <p>And mocks the song</p>
        <p>Of peace on earth, good-will to men!'"</p>
		<p>It seemed to Longfellow that there was no peace on earth, and that  there was only continual hate. Do you ever feel this way? Do you ever feel that in this world there is no peace? This is how David felt in Psalm fifty-three. In Psalm 53:1-3, David writes,</p>
		<p>“The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’ They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none who does good. God looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God. Every one of them has turned aside; They have together become corrupt; There is none who does good, No, not one.”</p>
		<p>He says that there is no one that does good. We live in an evil world.  1 John 5:19  says,</p>
		<p>“We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.”</p>
		<p>The world is wicked, But God is good. We need to be on God’s side. But if the world is evil, and we are in the world, how are we suposed to be good? If all we see is evil, how can we do good? John 15:18-20 says,</p>
		<p>“If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.”</p>
		<p>God has called us to be in the world but not of the world. We cannot separate ourselves from the world, because we are in the world. The world might hate us because we are not acting like the world, and Jesus says that the world will hate us, but he also says that the world hated him first. Jesus didn’t give us just a command, he has given us the example. The example of living in and not of the world. He shows us that it is possible. But since the world is not peaceful, it is wicked, can we ever have peace? Here is another part of his poem,</p>
		<p>"Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:</p>
        <p>'God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
        <p>The Wrong shall fail,</p>
        <p>The Right prevail,</p>
        <p>With peace on earth, good-will to men.'"</p>
		<p>Longfellow is saying that God is still here, in the midst of the wars, in the mist of the chaos, in the mist of all the evil and unrest and tumult, God is in control. He writes, “The Wrong shall fail, the Right prevail, With peace on earth, good-will to men. We are living in an evil, warfilled, terrible world. The wrong won’t prevail, but the right will, so choose the winning side. John 14:27 says,</p>
		<p>“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</p>
		<p>We are given peace by Jesus. Jesus has left us peace. Through the darkness of this world Jesus has given us light. We don’t have to be afraid of this world, because God is on our side. And according to Romans 8:31, which says,</p>
		<p>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?”</p>
		<p>We don’t have to be afraid, we don’t have to worry, because God has our back. We don’t have to be afraid of the world, because God is with us.</p>
		<p>Romans 5:1  says,</p>
		<p>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,”</p>
		<p>We are left peace by Jesus, and we are able to have that peace through faith. We are justified by our faith which gives us peace with God through Jesus. The world might be full of evil. The world might be full of conflict, unrighteousness, and war, but Jesus leaves us peace in the mist of it all. We might be weary because we have to live in such a terrible world, but listen to what Jesus tells us,</p>
		<p>“Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28</p>
		<p>Isn’t that amazing news! Though this life may be getting you down, We can have peace. And we can have rest. Philipians 4:6-7 says,</p>
		<p> “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”</p>
		<p>We are not to be anxious about this world or anything else, But we are to go to God, the God that has our back, in prayer. And what does this verse say will happen when we go to him in prayer? It says that we will be given peace. Not just any peace though, we will be given peace that surpasses all understanding, and that peace will guard our hearts and minds through Chrst Jesus. John 16:33 says,</p>
		<p>“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</p>
		<p>In this life, we may have tribulation, but Jesus gives us peace, for He has overcome this world. He has beat death, and allowed us a way to be with him even though we were once just like the world. Through baptism we are able to reach his blood and have our sins washed away, having the peace and assurance that we can be with him someday. Back in Romans chapter eight, the next verse, verse 32 says,</p>
		<p>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”</p>
		<p>So we learn that not only is God on our side, not only is God for us, but he didn’t even spare his only son for us, but sent him to this earth to die for us. God gave us an opportunity to be on his side, and to have peace, through the death of his son.</p>
